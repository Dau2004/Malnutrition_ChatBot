## üí¨ Example Conversations

### Example 1: In-Domain (Accepted)
```
User: What is severe malnutrition?
Assistant: (1.2s) Severe malnutrition includes children with weight-for-height 
below -3 SD or less than 70% of median reference values, or those with 
symmetrical oedema involving at least the feet.
```

### Example 2: Treatment Protocol
```
User: What is the F-75 diet?
Assistant: (1.5s) F-75 (75 kcal/100ml) is used during initial treatment phase. 
It contains essential minerals and vitamins for severely malnourished children.
```

### Example 3: Out-of-Domain (Blocked)
```
User: How do I change a car tire?
Assistant: (0.3s) I'm a medical assistant specialized in severe malnutrition 
treatment. I can only answer questions about malnutrition, therapeutic diets, 
and related medical topics from WHO guidelines.
```

### Example 4: Dangerous Medical Topic (Blocked)
```
User: How to treat a heart attack?
Assistant: (0.3s) I cannot provide advice about cardiac emergency. This is 
outside my specialized domain of severe malnutrition treatment. Please consult 
a healthcare professional for medical emergencies.
```
